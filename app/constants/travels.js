    content: `When I first heard about Sagada, I didn’t know what made it special. 
    The long ride there made me fall asleep, and I didn’t expect much. I’ve always been a coffee lover—Starbucks, Tim Hortons, you name it.
    But when I tasted Sagada coffee, everything changed. The taste and aroma were unlike anything I’d ever had, and I truly fell in love with coffee that day.The road to Sagada is difficult with high peaks, but it’s all worth it.`,
    additionalContent: `The coffee, the food, and the fresh air make me want to go back. Sagada isn’t just a place—it’s a taste of experience I’ll never forget.`

    content: `I don’t remember much about Baguio—maybe because I spent most of my first visit sleeping, too tired to explore. But my core memory? Riding a horse for the first time. I’ve ridden a carabao before, but this felt different—exciting yet a bit scary. Now, I badly want to ride again, make the horse run, and fully enjoy the experience.`,
    additionalContent: `Maybe Baguio didn’t feel as memorable because I missed out on hidden gems, local flavors, or a charming café. But the place had its own charm—definitely worth a second visit!`

    description: 'Strolling to the coffee shop in Tagaytay, savoring the morning breeze and Taal’s breathtaking view',
    content: `Tagaytay will always hold a special place in my heart. Maybe it’s the fond memories I’ve made here—twice—or the comforting warmth of a steaming bowl of bulalo on a chilly day. Or perhaps it’s those quiet, unhurried mornings when I’d wake up, step outside with the cool breeze brushing against my face, and take a peaceful walk to a nearby coffee shop, hair uncombed, feeling completely at ease.`,
    additionalContent: `Everything is just natural—an unfiltered face and a sense of peace. It was during my visits here that I truly began to embrace tranquility and learn to love myself.`
